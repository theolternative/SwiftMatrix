# SwiftMatrix

SwiftMatrix is a Swift library that leverages [Accelerate framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate) power to provide high-performance functions for matrix math.   

**SwiftMatrix has been developed trying to mimic syntax used in linear algebra as much as possible in order to simplify coding of complex operations**
